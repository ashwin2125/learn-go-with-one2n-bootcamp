- Basics/Fundamentals are the most critical part of learning any programming language.
- Satisfied that I refreshed the basics of Go yet again.
- I will be writing this self-reflection of all my learnings each day in this file.
- I have covered the basics of Go today and will aim to complete the 'Methods' tomorrow. 

_Until then, see ya!_
